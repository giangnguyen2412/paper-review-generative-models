# Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets

## Summary
In an unconditioned generative model, there is no control on modes of the data being generated. 
However, by conditioning the model on additional information it is possible to direct the data generation process.

The architecture is the exactly the same with the vanilla GAN but now we add the label (c) to both the inputs of Generator and Discriminator.
For example, the input of Generator is latent variable z and c, we have to use an embedding layer to concatenate these
two variables and scale the output to fit the output size of the Generator.
The same is done on the Discriminator.

The objective function is kept unchanged.
